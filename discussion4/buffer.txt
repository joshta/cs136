Docket No. NHTSA-2016-0126
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; V2V Communications

AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT)

ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).

DARPA staff, in discussing V2V cybersecurity issues with DOT researchers, recommended these techniques be included in any V2V requirements going.

In March 2014, researchers from Galois, Inc. issued a white paper with specific recommendations for reducing security risk associated with V2V communications, which they stated would “automatically rule out a whole class of security vulnerabilities” at low cost with known technologies.179 The recommendations were as follows:

 All legal inputs shall be specified precisely using a grammar. Inputs shall only represent data, not computation, and all data types shall be unambiguous (i.e., not machine-dependent). Maximum sizes shall be specified to help reduce denial-of- service and overflow attacks.

 Every input shall be checked to confirm that it conforms to the input specification. Interface messages shall be traceable to mission-critical functionality. Non-required messages should be rejected.

 Parsers and serializers shall be generated, not hand-written, to ensure they do not themselves introduce any security vulnerabilities. Evidence should be provided that
    parse(serialize(m)) = m, for all messages m, and 
    parse(i) = REJECT, for all non-valid inputs i.

 Fuzz testing shall be used to demonstrate that implementations are resilient to malicious inputs.

 A standardized crypto solution such as AES-GCM shall be used to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and the impossibility of reply attacks.
